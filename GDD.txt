Future Modules:
Fuel Cells for Electric Energy
Hydrolysis Module (Hydrogen-/Oxygen Generator)
(Thermo-) Nuclear Reactors for Electric Energy
Rocket Thruster

Multiplayer:
Enum method = { Spawn, Despawn, UpdatePosition, ... }
method-index gets send over network instead of string name
method-struct with delegate (delegate calls the real method), parameter- and maybe returntype-info (how do these infos look like?)
create array with method-structs at startup
index will be method-enum-index, value the corresponding struct
see http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Performance_of_Method.Invoke_vs_a_Delegate.aspx for delegates
when receiving index and parameters over network, start delegate
