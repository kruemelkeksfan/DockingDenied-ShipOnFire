Physics 2.0
	Subscenes + Rails
	Analytic Orbits for on-railed Objects
	1 Unit = 1m for un-railed Objects
	Flickering Fix
	Draw Orbits	
New Quest System
	Story Quests (semi-random Quests which provide Tutorial++, steer Progression, unlock new Parts/Components/Ship Blueprints and provide End Goal)
	only generate Quests for which the Requirements are met by the current Ship
	various Tiers: bigger Ships get more difficult Quests and later Quests require bigger Ships (how to manage Progression?)
	Rework Tutorial
Feedback Fixes
Building System 2.0
	Enable spawning Blueprints over existing Ships when external Constructor is used and has enough Capacity to store all Deconstruction Materials
	Spawn Starter Ship instead of blank Command Module
	Multiple Ships
	Copy-Paste-Building
	Disconnected Build Fix
		Disconnected Parts are copied to Clipboard
		Physically they continue existing, block building and can float into Infinity
		Physically they are Trash and can be deconstructed or attacked
		If they stay in Range of the Constructor and the Clipboard Content is pasted, they are automatically deconstructed
		When Clipboard Content is pasted and the Trash is out-of-Range or was damaged, Player has to pay the Building Cost Difference
	CPU-System for limiting Ship Size (like Robocraft)
Economy 2.0
	Un-randomize Economy
	Production Stations (cheaper Prices for some Goods)
	Resource Draining Events (Plagues, Attacks, Famines, Storage Module Fires, ...)
	De-fund Starting Stocks of Stations to make the System poorer
	AI Traders
		Just virtual, no actual Ships
		Certain Amount of Traders (affects overall Resource Distribution Effectivity)
		Have unlimited Cash
		Algorithm:
			Buy Cheapest Goods at Station until? (Cargo Bay is full? Prices are too high? Station is empty?)
			Allow only 1 Trader Transaction at once, to avoid all Traders buying the same Stuff and going the same Route
			Travel to Station where they could sell for Max Profit (Travel Time depends linearly on Distance)
			On Arrival, sell all their Cargo, no Matter how the Stocks changed
			Repeat

Multiplayer
	Enum method = { Spawn, Despawn, UpdatePosition, ... }
	method-index gets send over network instead of string name
	method-struct with delegate (delegate calls the real method), parameter- and maybe returntype-info (how do these infos look like?)
	create array with method-structs at startup
	index will be method-enum-index, value the corresponding struct
	see http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Performance_of_Method.Invoke_vs_a_Delegate.aspx for delegates
	when receiving index and parameters over network, start delegate
