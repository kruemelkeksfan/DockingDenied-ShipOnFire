Draw Orbits
Economy 2.0
New Quest System
	only generate Quests for which the Requirements are met by the current Ship
	various Tiers: bigger Ships get more difficult Quests and later Quests require bigger Ships (how to manage Progression?)
Unlock System for Modules
	(How?)
Multiple Ships
Copy-Paste-Building/Disconnected Build Fix
Flickering Fix
	put Ship Renderers in second Scene with more appropriate Scale
	possibly join all Module Models to a single Model for Performance Reasons
	draw Ship with a Camera in the second Scene
	render Camera above Main Camera in primary Scene
	if Ships are too far apart in the secondary Scene (e.g. further than View Distance), disregard the Proportions in Ship Positions
		maybe difficult for more than 2 Ships, Ship A and B could be close together, but Ship C is close to A but not close to B. Solution?
Mining
Combat
Crew
Multiplayer
	Enum method = { Spawn, Despawn, UpdatePosition, ... }
	method-index gets send over network instead of string name
	method-struct with delegate (delegate calls the real method), parameter- and maybe returntype-info (how do these infos look like?)
	create array with method-structs at startup
	index will be method-enum-index, value the corresponding struct
	see http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Performance_of_Method.Invoke_vs_a_Delegate.aspx for delegates
	when receiving index and parameters over network, start delegate
More Modules
	Fuel Cells for Electric Energy
	Hydrolysis Module (Hydrogen-/Oxygen Generator)
	(Thermo-) Nuclear Reactors for Electric Energy
	Rocket Thruster
Factions
Radar System to detect missing Vessels and Enemies?
CPU-System for limiting Ship Size (like Robocraft)?
