Physics 2.0
	Subscenes + Rails
	Analytic Orbits for on-railed Objects
	1 Unit = 1m for un-railed Objects
	Flickering Fix
	Draw Orbits
	Pausing and Time Scale
	Moment of Inertia for Ships (http://dmorris.net/projects/tutorials/inertia.tensor.summary.pdf)
Feedback Fixes
Component System
	Radiators
 		Components for Reactors, Weapons, Thrusters, Shields, etc.
		Low Grade Radiators lead to overheating and Dysfunction
Combat
	Combat Quests/Boss Fights
	Weapons
		Liquid Cooled Machineguns
			Low Range
			High Cadence
			Solid Ammo
			Low Impact
			Low Penetration
			Very low Debris Pollution per Shot, but many Shots
		Explosive Cannons
			Medium Range
			Low Cadence
			Different Ammo Types
			Low-High Impact (depending on Ammo Type)
			Low-Medium Penetration (depending on Ammo Type, HEATs?)
			High Debris Pollution per Shot
		Railguns
			Long Range, Highest Precision
			Low Cadence
			Solid Ammo
			Require lots of Energy per Shot
			Requires good Capacitors
			Medium Impact
			High Penetration
			Medium Debris Pollution per Shot
		Explosive Rockets
			Infinite Range
			Can be launched into a Rendevous Orbit with their Target
			If they get close to the Target (e.g. 50km), they switch to direct Homing and leave their Orbit
			Large Impact
			Low Penetration
			Very high Debris Pollution per Rocket
		No Lasers
			Would be easy to reflect or defy otherwise (Cooling, heat-resistant Materials, ...)
			Would produce a lot of difficult to manage Waste Heat on the firing Vessel
		Firing Procedure
			Player selects
				Target Vessel
				Target Point/Module
				Sets a "Spray Area" (Gun Variation)
			Calculate Lead
				Naive (just calculate Lead from Distance and Velocities) or use Analytical Orbit, depending on Performance Implications
				Iterative
					Because Distance changes with every new Lead Calculation
					Recalculate until new Lead is almost identical to old Lead or maximum Iteration Count is reached
					Display Error of last Calculation for Player Fire Decision
			Fire Bullet towards Lead Point and calculate it until it leaves the unrail-Box
				Projectiles are not affected by Gravity for Simplicity and Performance (superior Target Computer would adjust for Gravity anyways)
			Store Timestamp for projected Arrival Time
			On Timestamp, load Collider of Target and its Vicinity
			Calculate Bullet Spawn Point before Target and Bullet Direction from Accuracy and Shooter Location
			Spawn Bullet and track it into Target
			Hit?
				Yes - Apply Damage
				No - Increase Debris Count
	Debris System
		Debris can damage Modules if not neutralized by Shields
		Shields pulverize (?) or magnetize and suck in (?) Debris (or how does it become neutralized?)
		Stations have strong Shields and catch lots of Debris
		Global Debris Level
			Debris is produced by
				Missing Shots in Combat
				Destructing Modules in Combat
			Steers chance of random Debris spawning in un-railed Areas
				Whats this Chance exactly? Certainly a Function of Debris Count, but whats the Base Chance for 1 Particle?
				Look up Thermodynamic Equations, e.g. p = 2m(N/V)v^2 => Chance that a Particle hits the Wall of a Cube?
			Level is reduced passively by on-railed Stations
			Level is reduced by neutralized Debris in un-railed Areas
	Shields
		Protect from
			Debris Impacts
			Projectiles
			Rockets
			Collisions
		Consume Power for building up Shield
		Power Loss on Impact calculated from Penetrator kinetic Energy
		Can set Coverage Area
			Final Shield Strength is Base Strength / Coverage Area
	Scanner/Sensors
		Component for Command Module
		Different Ranges (ca. 500-5000km)
		2 Types
			Sensors
				Observe all Objects in Radius
				Can locate
					Spacecraft
					Rockets
				Detection Range depends on
					Heat Signature
						depends on
							Object Size (Solar Radiation)
							Electric Consumption
							Fuel Consumption
							Sensor Quality
				Displays Warnings when detecting incoming Rockets/Collisions
				Passive (undetectable)
			Scanners
				Only observe a certain Angle
				Rotation/Look Direction adjusted manually
				Vastly superior Range
				Can locate
					Spacecraft
					Asteroids
					Projectiles/Rockets
				Detection Range depends on
					Object Speed
					Object Size
					Scanner Quality
				More Info on tracked Objects
					Modules
					HP
				Detection Angles depends on Scanner Quality
				Displays Warnings when detecting incoming Projectiles/Rockets/Collisions
				Active (gives away Sender Position)
New Quest System
	Abandon JSON and generate Quests from pure Code
	Story Quests (semi-random Quests which provide Tutorial++, steer Progression, unlock new Parts/Components/Ship Blueprints and provide End Goal)
	only generate Quests for which the Requirements are met by the current Ship
	various Tiers: later Quests require bigger Ships and spawn further away from Stations
	Generate Task, Tier, Amount/Difficulty (depending on Tier), Spawn Distance (depending on Tier) and Rewards (depending on Difficulty and Spawn Distance)
	Difficult Tasks/Boss Fights in Story Quests as memorable Milestones
	Rework Tutorial
Multiplayer
	Enum method = { Spawn, Despawn, UpdatePosition, ... }
	method-index gets send over network instead of string name
	method-struct with delegate (delegate calls the real method), parameter- and maybe returntype-info (how do these infos look like?)
	create array with method-structs at startup
	index will be method-enum-index, value the corresponding struct
	see http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Performance_of_Method.Invoke_vs_a_Delegate.aspx for delegates
	when receiving index and parameters over network, start delegate
Building System 2.0
	Construction via Contructors should cost Energy and possibly Time
	Enable spawning Blueprints over existing Ships when external Constructor is used and has enough Capacity to store all Deconstruction Materials
	Spawn Starter Ship instead of blank Command Module
	Multiple Ships
	Copy-Paste-Building
	Disconnected Build Fix
		Disconnected Parts are copied to Clipboard
		Physically they continue existing, block building and can float into Infinity
		Physically they are Trash and can be deconstructed or attacked
		If they stay in Range of the Constructor and the Clipboard Content is pasted, they are automatically deconstructed
		When Clipboard Content is pasted and the Trash is out-of-Range or was damaged, Player has to pay the Building Cost Difference
	Symmetry Modes
	Categories for Modules
	CPU-System for limiting Ship Size (like Robocraft)
	Somehow show CoM of individual Vessel AND CoM of all docked Vessels together
	Redesign Command Module
		Spacecraft don't have Windows
		Pressure Hull on current Module would be a Nightmare
	Lore
		Planetary Nations are afraid of Cruise Missiles
		Therefore they agreed on a "Free Flight Zone" around the equatorial Plane
		Zone is very narrow, about 20m, to restrict possible planetary Attacks to a small Area
		Spacecraft outside the Zone (even just partially outside) will be fired upon from the Surface
Mining
	Refineries for Ore to Material Conversion (different Components for different Materials)
	Bloomeries for Iron + Steel Ingredients to Steel Conversion
Economy 2.0
	Un-randomize Economy
	Production Stations (cheaper Prices for some Goods)
	Resource Draining Events (Plagues, Attacks, Famines, Storage Module Fires, ...)
	De-fund Starting Stocks of Stations to make the System poorer
	AI Traders
		Just virtual, no actual Ships
		Certain Amount of Traders (affects overall Resource Distribution Effectivity)
		Have unlimited Cash
		Algorithm:
			Buy Cheapest Goods at Station until? (Cargo Bay is full? Prices are too high? Station is empty?)
			Allow only 1 Trader Transaction at once, to avoid all Traders buying the same Stuff and going the same Route
			Travel to Station where they could sell for Max Profit (Travel Time depends linearly on Distance)
			On Arrival, sell all their Cargo, no Matter how the Stocks changed
			Repeat
More Modules
	Fuel Cells for Electric Energy
	Hydrolysis Module (Hydrogen-/Oxygen Generator)
	(Thermo-) Nuclear Reactors for Electric Energy
	Rocket Thruster
	Radar System to detect missing Vessels and Enemies?
