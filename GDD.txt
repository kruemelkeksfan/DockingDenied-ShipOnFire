Combat
	Weapons
		Liquid Cooled Machineguns
			Low Range
			High Cadence
			Solid Ammo
			Low Impact
			Low Penetration
			Very low Debris Pollution per Shot, but many Shots
		Explosive Cannons
			Medium Range
			Low Cadence
			Different Ammo Types
			Low-High Impact (depending on Ammo Type)
			Low-Medium Penetration (depending on Ammo Type, HEATs?)
			High Debris Pollution per Shot
		Railguns
			Long Range, Highest Precision
			Low Cadence
			Solid Ammo
			Require lots of Energy per Shot
			Requires good Capacitors
			Medium Impact
			High Penetration
			Medium Debris Pollution per Shot
		Explosive Rockets
			Infinite Range
			Can be launched into a Rendevous Orbit with their Target
			If they get close to the Target (e.g. 50km), they switch to direct Homing and leave their Orbit
			Large Impact
			Low Penetration
			Very high Debris Pollution per Rocket
		No Lasers
			Would be easy to reflect or defy otherwise (Cooling, heat-resistant Materials, ...)
			Would produce a lot of difficult to manage Waste Heat on the firing Vessel
		Firing Procedure
			Player selects
				Target Vessel
				Target Point/Module
				Sets a "Spray Area" (Gun Variation)
			Calculate Lead
				Naive (just calculate Lead from Distance and Velocities) or use Analytical Orbit, depending on Performance Implications
				Iterative
					Because Distance changes with every new Lead Calculation
					Recalculate until new Lead is almost identical to old Lead or maximum Iteration Count is reached
					Display Error of last Calculation for Player Fire Decision
			Fire Bullet towards Lead Point and calculate it until it leaves the unrail-Box
				Projectiles are not affected by Gravity for Simplicity and Performance (superior Target Computer would adjust for Gravity anyways)
			Store Timestamp for projected Arrival Time
			On Timestamp, load Collider of Target and its Vicinity
			Calculate Bullet Spawn Point before Target and Bullet Direction from Accuracy and Shooter Location
			Spawn Bullet and track it into Target
			Hit?
				Yes - Apply Damage
				No - Increase Debris Count
	Debris System
		Debris can damage Modules if not neutralized by Shields
		Shields pulverize (?) or magnetize and suck in (?) Debris (or how does it become neutralized?)
		Stations have strong Shields and catch lots of Debris
		Global Debris Level
			Debris is produced by
				Missing Shots in Combat
				Destructing Modules in Combat
			Steers chance of random Debris spawning in un-railed Areas
				Whats this Chance exactly? Certainly a Function of Debris Count, but whats the Base Chance for 1 Particle?
				Look up Thermodynamic Equations, e.g. p = 2m(N/V)v^2 => Chance that a Particle hits the Wall of a Cube?
			Level is reduced passively by on-railed Stations
			Level is reduced by neutralized Debris in un-railed Areas
	Shields
		Protect from
			Debris Impacts
			Projectiles
			Rockets
			Collisions
		Consume Power for building up Shield
		Power Loss on Impact calculated from Penetrator kinetic Energy
		Can set Coverage Area
			Final Shield Strength is Base Strength / Coverage Area
	Scanner/Sensors
		Component for Command Module
		Different Ranges (ca. 500-5000km)
		Space Stations are always visible
		For Quest Vessels, last known Position is marked
		Players can ping Positions, Pings stay visible for about 10 Seconds
		2 Types
			Sensors
				Observe all Objects in Radius
				Can locate
					Spacecraft
					Rockets
				Detection Range depends on
					Heat Signature
						depends on
							Object Size (Solar Radiation)
							Electric Consumption
							Fuel Consumption
							Sensor Quality
				Displays Warnings when detecting incoming Rockets/Collisions
				Passive (undetectable)
			Scanners
				Only observe a certain Angle
				Rotation/Look Direction adjusted manually
				Vastly superior Range
				Can locate
					Spacecraft
					Asteroids
					Projectiles/Rockets
				Detection Range depends on
					Object Speed
					Object Size
					Scanner Quality
				More Info on tracked Objects
					Modules
					HP
				Detection Angles depends on Scanner Quality
				Displays Warnings when detecting incoming Projectiles/Rockets/Collisions
				Active (gives away Sender Position)
Crew
	Every Component can have Personnel-Slots
	Every Module with Personnel-Slot Components can get a Living Quarter Component
	Living Quarter Component can contain a Garrison to protect the Module
	People can have Equipment
		Personal Shield
		Weapon
			Pistol
				Cheap
				Fast Draw Time
				Low Damage and DPS
			Submachine Gun
				High continuous DPS
				Medium Draw Time
			Shotgun
				High Burst Damage
				Low continuos DPS
				High Draw Time
		Ammo
			Pistol/SMG Ammo
			Shotgun Ammo
	Boarding Fights
		Starts by Docking to an disabled Docking Port
		Port will be hacked by Hacking Component in Docking Port
			Time taken determined by Hacking Component Quality and Access Control Component Quality in other Port
		Boarding Crew is assembled in a separate Screen by the Attacker
			Boarding Crew has a Personnel Limit (4?)
		Boarders can move from Module to Module
		In each Module Boarders have to fight Defenders before moving on
			Boarders and Defenders have a Line-Up
			First Person in Line-Up has the biggest Chance to be fired upon, last Member has the least Chance
			The attacked Person is determined randomly on Beginning of the Fight or than the currently attacked Person dies
			Persons die when their Personal Shield runs out
			One Side wins, when all other Opponents are dead or one Side retreats to another Module
		Boarders can temporarily (until the End of the Fight) disable or destroy Modules with defeated Defenders
		To end the Fight, Boarders have to defeat 50% of the defending Personnel and capture the Command Module
	Experience
		Different Skills for different Personnel-Slot-Types and Combat Activities (Pistols, SMGs, Shotguns, Personal Shields)
		Crew gains Experience passively by executing Actions
		Level-Ups in these Skills improve Performance	
New Quest System
	Abandon JSON and generate Quests from pure Code
	Story Quests (semi-random Quests which provide Tutorial++, steer Progression, unlock new Parts/Components/Ship Blueprints and provide End Goal)
	Only generate Quests for which the Requirements are met by the current Ship
	Task Types
		Destroy
		Jump-Start
		Supply (Reward must be larger than Investment)
		Tow
		Race
		Taxi/Transport
		(Plunder)
		(Build)
		No Buy/Sell Quests
	Various Tiers: later Quests require bigger Ships and spawn further away from Stations
	Generate Task, Tier, Amount/Difficulty (depending on Tier), Spawn Distance (depending on Tier) and Rewards (depending on Task Type, Difficulty and Spawn Distance)
	Task Type depends on Quest Tier, no Towing Quests at Start
	Difficult Tasks/Boss Fights in Story Quests as memorable Milestones
	Rework Tutorial
	Spawn Quest Vessels on Quest Generation and instead of on Acceptance
	Rename QuestVessel to NPC Vessel or something else more neutral
	Spawn ambient NPC Vessels
Multiplayer
	Send-Receive-Mechanism
		Following might be obsolete, in Case of Doubt stick to Tinkers Throne Architecture
		Enum methods = { Spawn, Despawn, UpdatePosition, ... }
		Method-Index gets send over Network instead of String Name
		Method-Struct with Delegate (Delegate calls the real Method), Parameter- and maybe Returntype-Info (how do these infos look like?)
		Create Array with Method-Structs at startup
		Index will be Method-Enum-Index, Value the corresponding Struct
		see http://www.thejoyofcode.com/Performance_of_Method.Invoke_vs_a_Delegate.aspx for Delegates
		When receiving Index and Parameters over Network, start Delegate
	Host Architecture
		1 Scene per Player
		1 Scene is Master Scene which tracks which Objects belong to which Scene
		Master Scene implemented via Singleton with lazy Initialization
		Master Scene also manages all Objects which are not in unrail-Distance of any Player
		When in multiple Scenes, Objects belong to Scene they entered first
		Every Scene communicates with its corresponding Client
Building System 2.0
	Construction via Contructors should cost Energy and possibly Time
	Enable spawning Blueprints over existing Ships when external Constructor is used and has enough Capacity to store all Deconstruction Materials
	Spawn Starter Ship instead of blank Command Module
	Multiple Ships
	Copy-Paste-Building
	Disconnected Build Fix
		Disconnected Parts are copied to Clipboard
		Physically they continue existing, block building and can float into Infinity
		Physically they are Trash and can be deconstructed or attacked
		If they stay in Range of the Constructor and the Clipboard Content is pasted, they are automatically deconstructed
		When Clipboard Content is pasted and the Trash is out-of-Range or was damaged, Player has to pay the Building Cost Difference
	Symmetry Modes
	Categories for Modules
	CPU-System for limiting Ship Size (like Robocraft)
	Somehow show CoM of individual Vessel AND CoM of all docked Vessels together
	Redesign Command Module
		Spacecraft don't have Windows
		Pressure Hull on current Module would be a Nightmare
	Lore
		Planetary Nations are afraid of Cruise Missiles
		Therefore they agreed on a "Free Flight Zone" around the equatorial Plane
		Zone is very narrow, about 20m, to restrict possible planetary Attacks to a small Area
		Spacecraft outside the Zone (even just partially outside) will be fired upon from the Surface
	SpaceStations could take Ship Size into Account when assigning Docking Ports to Docking Requests (Collider Extents, Physics2D.OverlayBox)
Mining
	Refineries for Ore to Material Conversion (different Components for different Materials)
	Bloomeries for Iron + Steel Ingredients to Steel Conversion
Economy 2.0
	Un-randomize Economy
	Production Stations (cheaper Prices for some Goods)
	Resource Draining Events (Plagues, Attacks, Famines, Storage Module Fires, ...)
	De-fund Starting Stocks of Stations to make the System poorer
	AI Traders
		Just virtual, no actual Ships
		Certain Amount of Traders (affects overall Resource Distribution Effectivity)
		Have unlimited Cash
		Algorithm:
			Buy Cheapest Goods at Station until? (Cargo Bay is full? Prices are too high? Station is empty?)
			Allow only 1 Trader Transaction at once, to avoid all Traders buying the same Stuff and going the same Route
			Travel to Station where they could sell for Max Profit (Travel Time depends linearly on Distance)
			On Arrival, sell all their Cargo, no Matter how the Stocks changed
			Repeat
