## FAQ
#### Can I rotate Modules?
Press Q or E while the module is selected.

#### Can I delete Modules?
There is an "Erase"-button on the right side of the building menu.

#### Why does my Spacecraft not fly straight?
Check if your thrusters are placed symmetrically.

Toggle the center of mass display in the top bar of your screen and check if the center of mass is in the middle of your craft.

Containers are loaded one at a time, this can lead to imbalance. Therefore place containers as close to the center of thrust as possible.

Also check if you have enough energy, thrusters start to give uneven thrust when they are not supplied enough electric charge.

#### I can't control my Spacecraft, help me!
Press Q or E to stop unwanted rotation of your vessel.

For this to work properly, you will need at least 2 thrusters in at least 1 direction, instead of the bare minimum 1 thruster per direction.
An easy setup is 2 thrusters to the front and 2 towards the back and 1 thruster per side.
If this still does not help and you feel like you are pressing the wrong keys intuitively, change camera mode by pressing C.

#### My Log is spammed and I can't see the new Error Messages anymore!
Hold L to clear the log.

Also, if something does not work, don't spam the button. "Treat every piece of software as if it was Win95" is a good guideline.

#### Why am I not coming any closer, even though I have been accelerating towards my Target for Ages?
Thats difficult.

"However, the Gemini 4 attempts at rendezvous were unsuccessful largely because NASA engineers had yet to learn the orbital mechanics involved in the process. Simply pointing the active vehicle's nose at the target and thrusting was unsuccessful. If the target is ahead in the orbit and the tracking vehicle increases speed, its altitude also increases, actually moving it away from the target. The higher altitude then increases orbital period due to Kepler's third law, putting the tracker not only above, but also behind the target. The proper technique requires changing the tracking vehicle's orbit to allow the rendezvous target to either catch up or be caught up with, and then at the correct moment changing to the same orbit as the target with no relative motion between the vehicles (for example, putting the tracker into a lower orbit, which has a shorter orbital period allowing it to catch up, then executing a Hohmann transfer back to the original orbital height)."

In short: direct flying only works at short ranges and small velocity differences.
If your "Target Speed" keeps growing even though you are accelerating towards your target you are pretty much gg.
Either restart, choose another target or bring the "Orbital Speed" to 0 and wait until your target is closer (this will take a long time).
You can use the time to read up about orbital maneuvering and rendevouz procedures.
